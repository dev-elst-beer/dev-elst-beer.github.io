    <title>Elst Beer</title>
    <description>Maker of fine beer in Knoxville Tennessee.  We are inspired by the  tradition of Trappist Belgian breweries.  We also have a deep connection  with our home town of Knoxville and the beauty of the Smoky Mountains that  surround it.  Our goal is to create fine beers that speak to people with an  obsession for beer.

        <title>Introducing Elst Brewing Co!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hellooooo Knoxville!!!  Elst Brewing Company is proud to announce that we are actively working on securing a property on North Central St. in the Oakwood neighborhood.  We will start with a tasting room that will serve our favorite beers from around town and around the world.  The opening of the tasting room will soon be followed by the opening of our own brewery to share our creations with the Knoxville community.  Target opening for the tasting room is Fall 2017 with the brewery opening Winter 2017/2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Elst team is a group of friends and neighbors that all share the same vision for creating world class beer in our home town of Knoxville, TN.  We have spent many years crafting recipes, studying brewing, and researching the possibility of opening our own brewery.  The opportunity we have been looking for has finally come together and we feel like it is the perfect time to join the growing group of breweries in the Knoxville area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We love to create all styles of beer!  From the subtle flavors of traditional styles to explosive experimental ales, Elst wants to provide an experience with every beer that we make.  We believe that every glass is an opportunity to think, wonder, and enjoy the â€¦&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
